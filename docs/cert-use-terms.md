ModMed
Certified API Terms of Use
Last Updated: December 23, 2022
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. In these Certified API Terms of Use (“CAPI TOU”), Modernizing Medicine, Inc.
and its affiliates (including Modernizing Medicine Gastroenterology, Inc.,
Modernizing Medicine Podiatry Systems, Inc., and Exscribe, Inc.) will be
referred to as “ModMed” and terms like “we”, “our”, or “us”. Capitalized terms
used in these CAPI TOU without definition will have the meanings in Appendix
1.
1.2. These CAPI TOU govern your access to and use of our CAPI Services. Please
read these CAPI TOU carefully before you use the CAPI Services as they are a
legal agreement between ModMed and you once they are accepted. The CAPI
Services are also governed by our Terms of Use (“TOU”), which also include
terms related to other ModMed services, including our websites. These CAPI
TOU are incorporated into and are part of the TOU (the CAPI TOU and the TOU,
collectively, the “CAPI Terms”). Please also review our Privacy Policy to learn
about our information collection, use, and privacy practices. For example, our
Privacy Policy applies to any personal information we may collect when you use
the CAPI Services. For clarity, these CAPI TOU do not apply to the Proprietary
APIs, which terms may be found here.
1.3. By using or accessing any of the CAPI Services you accept and agree to
be bound by the CAPI Terms. If you do not agree with any portion of the CAPI
Terms, then do not use any CAPI Services. You represent and warrant that you
are at least 18 years old and that you possess the legal ability to accept the
CAPI Terms.
1.4. If you are using the CAPI Services on behalf of an entity, then: (i) you represent
and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the CAPI Terms, (ii)
you agree to be bound by the CAPI Terms on behalf of that entity, (iii) you will
require all users to comply with the CAPI Terms, and (iv) references to “you”,
“your”, and similar terms refer to that entity.
1.5. If you have a Primary Agreement to use the CAPI Services. “Primary
Agreement” means: (i) for ModMed Customers, your Transaction Documents
(as defined in the TOU), (ii) if you are a ModMed Vendor, a written, binding
agreement between you and ModMed, and (iii) for Application providers who
are not ModMed Customers or ModMed Vendors, a written, binding agreement
between you and each ModMed Customer or Patient containing appropriate
terms to cover the Data you will be exfiltrating, or transmitting to us, via the
APIs. The Primary Agreement will set forth your rights and obligations related to
Data, including its access, use, provisioning, and retention. ModMed enters into
unique Primary Agreements with ModMed Customers and ModMed Vendors.
The CAPI Terms supplement Primary Agreements with respect to use of the
CAPI Services. In the event of a conflict between a Primary Agreement and the
CAPI Terms, (a) the CAPI Terms will control regarding use of the CAPI Services
and (b) the Primary Agreement will control regarding other matters, such as the
use, provisioning, and retention of Data.
2. REGISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
2.1. ModMed Customers. If you are a ModMed Customer and not using the CAPI
Services as an Application provider, then you will use your System user account
information as your Credentials to authenticate and to access and use the
CAPI.
2.2. Patients. If you are a Patient, then you will use your patient portal user account
information as Credentials to authenticate and to use the CAPI. Please note that
your provider is responsible for providing you with your Credentials and your
Credentials are specific to a particular ModMed Customer (e.g., if you are a
patient of multiple ModMed Customer, then you will need to enter your
Credentials for each ModMed Customer).
2.3. Application Providers. If you are an Application provider:
2.3.1. To access and use the CAPI Services, you must register by providing
certain information here. You must provide us with true, accurate, and
complete information on your registration and keep all provided information
up to date. As part of our review of your registration, we may request
additional information. Once you have completed your registration, we may
provide you with additional Credentials.
2.3.2. If we offer a Test Environment, you may use your Credentials to access
the Test Environment. In the Test Environment, you may only use test data;
you may not upload, transmit, or otherwise enter any “live” or “real” data.
Performance in the Test Environment may differ from that in the Production
Environment.
2.3.3. In certain cases, for Data to be exchanged via the CAPIs the applicable
ModMed Customer or Patient must activate use of such CAPIs in our
Systems. We are not responsible for any ModMed Customer’s failure or
delay in activating any CAPIs or deactivation of any CAPIs.
2.4. Credentials. You must protect your Credentials. Do not let anyone else use
your Credentials and do not use anyone else’s Credentials. Notify us
immediately if: (i) your Credentials are lost or stolen, (ii) you become aware of
any unauthorized use of your Credentials, or (iii) you become aware of any
unauthorized use of the CAPI Services or any other breach of security that
might affect the CAPI Services. You are fully responsible for any activity under
your account. Credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
3. USE OF THE CAPI SERVICES
3.1. Permission to Use the CAPI Services. If you are a ModMed Customer or a
Patient, then we grant you the right to use the CAPI Services to provide an
Application access to your Data. If you are an Application provider, we grant
you the right to: (i) access and use the CAPI Services in a Production
Environment, (ii) use the CAPI Services to help you develop your Applications,
and (iii) market, offer, and distribute your Applications. TOU section 3.3.9 will
not apply to the CAPI Services.
3.2. Limited Rights. All rights we grant in the CAPI Terms are personal to you and
you may not transfer, assign, or sublicense them to others. We may revoke
these rights if you violate the CAPI Terms or any applicable Laws. The CAPI
Services are the proprietary property of ModMed or its third-party licensors and
are protected by intellectual property and other Laws. No rights are granted to
you relating to the CAPI Services except for the express rights granted to you in
the CAPI Terms. We reserve all rights in the CAPI Services not expressly
granted in these CAPI TOU.
3.3. Compliance; Regulatory.
3.3.1. You will, at your cost and expense, obtain all necessary regulatory

providing your Applications). You will not export the CAPI Services in
violation of applicable Laws.
3.3.2. If you are an Application provider, you must: (i) collect, process, use,
store, disclose, provide, and transfer Data only in compliance with all
applicable Laws, privacy policies, and third-party rights, (ii) if applicable,
only use Data for the limited purposes authorized in your Primary
Agreement, (iii) if applicable, notify ModMed Customers that their Data will
be available to your Applications, and (iv) provide legally-compliant privacy
notices and protections.
3.3.3. If you will be using the CAPIs to access or send Protected Health
Information on behalf of ModMed or a ModMed Customer, then you must
first have one or more Business Associate agreements (each a “Business
Associate Agreement”) with either us or each ModMed Customer to the
extent required by HIPAA. The CAPI Terms are not a Business Associate
Agreement and may not be construed as creating any Business Associate
relationship. By using the APIs to access or send Protected Health
Information, you represent and warrant that you have signed all Business
Associate Agreements or other arrangements as may be required for such
access or transmission to comply with HIPAA or any other applicable Laws.
3.4. Additional Obligations. Except as expressly authorized by these CAPI TOU,

Systems or any server, network, or system associated with the CAPI
Services or Systems;
3.4.9. Not attempt to breach, defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or
otherwise circumvent any firewall, encryption, security, authentication
routines, or software protection mechanisms in the CAPI Services or
Systems, including any such mechanism used to restrict or control the
functionality of the CAPI Services or Systems;
3.4.10. Not use any automated program, tool, or process (including web
crawlers, scrapers, robots, bots, spiders, and automated scripts) to access

are an Application provider, your Application) will not contain or introduce any
viruses or other harmful or malicious code, software, computer instructions,
devices, or techniques that can or were designed to threaten, infect, damage,
disable, or shut down the CAPI Services or the Systems or any other
technology, software, solution, equipment, or computer system (e.g., no
viruses, worms, Trojan horses, malware, etc.).
3.6. Open Source. If you are an Application provider, you represent and warrant
that your Applications will not contain any software code that is subject to a
license that, when used in conjunction with the CAPI Services, requires our
software code, or other software code combined or distributed with our
software code, to be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii)
licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (iii) redistributable at no
charge.
3.7. Costs and Technology Requirements. You will be responsible for all of your
own costs to perform under the CAPI Terms. You are solely responsible for
providing and maintaining, at your own risk, option, and expense, appropriate
software, hardware, and other technology needed for you to receive and use
the CAPI Services, which must comply with the CAPI Terms and the
Documentation. Please note that additional work may be required to use the
CAPI Services for ModMed Customers who have licensed on-premise
electronic health records systems.
3.8. Customer Support. If you are an Application provider, you will be solely
responsible for all aspects of the sales, enrollment, implementation of, training,
maintenance, and support related to a ModMed Customer’s use of your
Applications.
3.9. ModMed Customer Acknowledgements. If you are a ModMed Customer, you
acknowledge and agree that: (i) the Applications are Third-Party Services (as

4. CHANGES TO THE CAPI TERMS AND THE CAPI SERVICES
4.1. Changes to the CAPI Terms. We may change the CAPI Terms at any time. The
date last updated is at the top of the CAPI Terms. Please check the CAPI Terms
regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes to the CAPI Terms. We
will use reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to these CAPI TOU
before such changes take effect to afford you with a reasonable opportunity to
update your Applications to preserve compatibility with the CAPI Services, such
as by posting a notice directly on the CAPI Services, by sending an email
notification (if you have provided your email address to us), or by other
reasonable methods. Your use of the CAPI Services after changes to the CAPI
Terms means you have accepted the changes. If you do not agree with the
changes, stop using the CAPI Services before the changes take effect or
immediately upon learning of changes that have already taken effect. If you
accessed or used the CAPI Services before the initial effective date of the CAPI
Terms, your use of the CAPI Services after such effective date means you have
accepted the CAPI Terms and that you agree that the CAPI Terms govern your
use of the CAPI Services.
4.2. Changes to, and Monitoring of, the CAPI Services. (i) We may modify the
operation of, or any feature of, the CAPI Services at any time. We will use
reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to the CAPI Services before
such changes take effect to afford you with a reasonable opportunity to update
your Applications to preserve compatibility with the CAPI Services, such as by
posting a notice directly on the CAPI Services, by sending an email notification
(if you have provided your email address to us), or by other reasonable
methods. (ii) We also may, with or without notice, and without liability to you or
any other party: (a) investigate any suspected or alleged misuse of the CAPI
Services and cooperate with any law enforcement or other governmental entity
or any other third parties in such investigation and (b) disclose information
about your use of the CAPI Services in connection with a law enforcement or
other governmental entity investigation or in response to a lawful court order or
subpoena. ModMed may monitor your use of the CAPI Services (including
accessing and using the Applications) in order to verify your compliance with
the CAPI Terms, improve the CAPI Services and Systems, and assess the
quality and security of the Applications. Currently, ModMed does not charge
any fees specific to the CAPI. If in the future we charge fees for the CAPIs, we
will update these CAPI TOU to include a description of such fees.
4.3. Updates.
4.3.1. ModMed may, but does not have to, develop and provide updates for our
CAPI Services, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches, and other
error corrections and new features (collectively, “Updates”). Updates may
also change or completely remove certain features and functionality. You
agree that ModMed has no obligation to provide any Updates or to
continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality.
4.3.2. Portions of the CAPI Services may not properly operate if you do not
install all Updates, so we encourage you to promptly install all Updates. We
may also suspend your access to CAPI Services until you install certain
Updates after providing you a reasonable opportunity to update your
technology. For clarity, all Updates are part of the CAPI Services and
subject to the CAPI Terms.
5. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION
5.1. Your Termination. Subject to any obligations in a Primary Agreement you have
with ModMed, you may terminate your use of the CAPI Services by providing
written notice to ModMed at api@modmed.com.
5.2. Termination and Suspension. You acknowledge and agree that, to the extent
not inconsistent with applicable Law: (i) ModMed may at any time and without
liability, terminate or suspend your access to the CAPI Services, in whole or in
part, including if ModMed determines that: (a) you have violated the CAPI
Terms, a Primary Agreement, or any applicable Law, (b) any term of the CAPI
Terms violates applicable Law, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the
Stark Law, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the False Claims Act, (c) you or any
of your owners is excluded from participation in a Federal Health Care Program
(as defined in at 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(f)) or otherwise debarred, declared
ineligible, suspended, or otherwise sanctioned by any federal or state
government, or (d) if ModMed believes your use of the CAPI Services is
unauthorized presents a security threat, is for fraudulent purposes, or interferes
with others’ use of the CAPI Services, (ii) such termination or suspension may
happen without prior notice, and (iii) in the event of such termination or
suspension, ModMed may immediately deactivate and terminate your account
and terminate your access to the CAPI Services.
5.3. Suspension and Downtime. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, we may limit, suspend access to or shut down the CAPI Services entirely
or in part at any time, including in order to: (i) fix problems with the CAPI
Services, (ii) conduct routine maintenance, or (iii) update the CAPI Services as
described in section 4.3. The CAPI Services may not always be available and
should not be relied upon in an emergency. In the event of downtime, other
temporary limits on, or unavailability of the CAPI Services, including to fix
problems with the CAPI Services, conduct routine maintenance, update the
CAPI Services, provide support services, remediate unplanned downtime, or
other planned or unplanned purpose, we will make commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the period of unavailability is no longer than necessary to
achieve the applicable purpose. ModMed will endeavor to implement such
limitation or suspension of access or shutdown of the CAPI Services in a
consistent and non-discriminatory manner and, if applicable, consistent with
any service level agreements under the CAPI Terms or the Primary Agreement.
5.4. Effect of Termination.
5.4.1. Upon any termination of the CAPI Terms: (i) all rights granted to you under
the CAPI Terms will cease and (ii) you must cease all use of the CAPI
Services.
5.4.2. Any provisions of the CAPI Terms that, by their nature should survive the
termination of the CAPI Terms, will survive, including sections: 5.4, 6.1, 6.3,
7, 8, 9, and 10.
6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
This section 6 applies to Application providers. ModMed Customers should refer to
their Primary Agreement regarding these matters.
6.1. Retention of Rights. Each party will retain all of its intellectual property rights.
6.2. Attribution.
6.2.1. ModMed may: (i) include you in our listings of companies connected via

distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other
content, from ModMed Customers’ use of the Applications.
6.2.2. You may make appropriate and truthful reference to ModMed in the
documentation for the Applications; provided, that: (i) you must not either
directly or indirectly, promote or advertise any Application as being
sponsored, endorsed, or recommended by ModMed and (ii) unless we have
provided you prior written consent in each instance, all references to
ModMed must be limited to plain word marks (e.g., no using our logos). You

name or other references to ModMed (e.g., in marketing materials, blogs,
press releases, etc.).
6.2.3. Except as expressly permitted in the CAPI Terms or the Primary
Agreement, neither party will refer to the other in any press release,
marketing materials, advertisements, or other public broadcast or
communication of any kind without first obtaining the other party’s prior
written consent.
6.3. Feedback. If you provide us with any comments, suggestions, ideas, or other
feedback (together, “Feedback”), you agree that: (i) you have no obligation to
provide Feedback, (ii) we have no obligation to use Feedback, (iii) we have an
unrestricted right to use and exploit any Feedback you do provide, including the
right to permit others to do both, and (iv) you are not entitled to receive any
compensation for any Feedback.

right to use Protected Health Information and other data to create data that is
de-identified in accordance with the HIPAA de-identification standard and (ii)
ModMed may use, sell, provide to third parties, and otherwise commercialize
any such de-identified data for any purpose not prohibited by Law. You agree
that nothing in the CAPI Terms will be deemed to restrict ModMed’s ability to
commercialize, market, license, use, provide to third parties, exploit, transform,
or sell such de-identified patient and other data.
7. NO WARRANTIES
THE CAPI SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MODMED MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPI SERVICES, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ALL
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
AND TITLE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE,
COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE IN TRADE. MODMED DOES NOT WARRANT: (i)
THAT THE CAPI SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, (ii) THAT
ANY DEFECT OR ERROR WILL BE CORRECTED, (iii) THAT THE CAPI SERVICES WILL
BE SECURE AND FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, (iv) THAT
ANY DATA PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE CAPI SERVICES WILL BE CURRENT
OR ACCURATE, OR (v) AGAINST ANY LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF ANY DATA OR
SUBMISSIONS. YOUR USE OF THE CAPI SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN
RISK.
8. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
8.1. IN NO EVENT WILL WE (WHICH, AS A REMINDER, INCLUDES OUR
AFFILIATES) OR ANY OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, ADVISORS, CONTRACTORS, OR
CONSULTANTS BE LIABLE TO YOU (WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT, TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY) FOR
(i) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
INFORMATION OF ANY KIND) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE
OF THE CAPI SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
LOSS OR DAMAGES OR (ii) DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THESE TERMS EXCEEDING, IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS, THE
GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE CAPI SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLAIM IN THE 6 MONTHS
PRIOR TO THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OR (B) $500.
8.2. EACH PROVISION OF THE CAPI TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE
BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS
SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE CAPI
TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THE CAPI TERMS WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY
LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
8.3. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES OR
TOTAL LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
9. INDEMNITY
In addition to any indemnification obligations you may have, you will indemnify
ModMed (which, as a reminder, includes affiliates) and our respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors, contractors, and consultants
(collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, actions, suits,
demands, liabilities, damages, losses, penalties, interest, fines, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) arising out of or related to: (i)
third-party claims arising out of or related to your use of, inability to use, or reliance
upon the CAPI Services, (ii) the Applications, including your provision of or use of any
Application, (iii) an Application provider’s act or omission (including a Data incident or
breach), or (iv) your violation of the CAPI Terms or applicable Law.
10. MISCELLANEOUS
10.1. Notice. ModMed may provide you with notices, including those regarding
changes to these CAPI TOU, by postings on our websites, on the CAPI
Services, or by other means (e.g., via email).
10.2. Governing Law. The CAPI Terms and any claim or dispute between you and
ModMed arising out of or relating to the CAPI Services or the CAPI Terms will
be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Florida, without regard to any provision of Florida Law that would require or
permit the application of the substantive Law of another jurisdiction. Any claim
or dispute between the parties will be resolved on an individual basis in the
state or federal courts of the State of Florida and the United States,
respectively, in or with jurisdiction over Palm Beach County, Florida. If you are a
United States city, county, or state government entity, then the following
applies instead of the language above: the parties agree to remain silent
regarding governing Law and venue.
10.3. Regulatory Acknowledgments. The parties’ intent is that the CAPI Terms
comply with the 21st Century Cures Act (including the Application Programming
Interfaces Conditions and Maintenance of Certification Requirements at 45
C.F.R. § 170.404) and any provision of the CAPI Terms that does not comply
with the 21st Century Cures Act will be replaced as described in section 10.5.
Nothing in the CAPI Terms will be construed to prohibit or restrict any
communication in a manner that violates the Condition of Certification at 45
C.F.R. § 170.403(a). Each party acknowledges and intends that the terms
contained in the CAPI Terms that relate to the content and manner of a request
for access, exchange, or use of electronic health information (as defined at 45
C.F.R. § 171.102) reflect the parties’ mutual agreement (in an arm’s-length
transaction without coercion) and meet the “content” and “manner requested”
conditions of the Content and Manner Exception at 45 C.F.R. §§ 171.301(a) and
(b)(1), respectively.
10.4. Waiver. A waiver of a provision of the CAPI Terms must be in writing and
signed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. ModMed’s failure
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the CAPI Terms will not
constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
10.5. Severability. If any provision of the CAPI Terms is declared void or
unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the parties will replace
such provision with a substitute that as closely as possible reflects the parties’
original intent (including economics and allocations of risk) and is enforceable,
and the validity of the other provisions and of the CAPI Terms as a whole will
not be affected.
10.6. Independent Contractor. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or
agency relationship exists between you and ModMed as a result of the CAPI
Terms or use of the CAPI Services. ModMed is not a third-party service
provider under PCI-DSS.
10.7. Force Majeure. ModMed will not be liable for failure or delay in performing
its obligations if such failure or delay is due to a force majeure event or other
circumstances beyond ModMed’s reasonable control, including acts of any
governmental body, war, cyber war or attack, terrorism, insurrection, sabotage,
embargo, fire, flood, severe weather, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, labor
disturbance, pandemic or other public health emergency, interruption of or
delay in the internet or transportation, unavailability of third-party services,
failure of third-party software or services, or inability to obtain raw materials,
supplies, or power used in or equipment needed for provision of the CAPI
Services.
10.8. Interpretation. Headings used in the CAPI Terms are for convenience only
and will not be used in interpreting the CAPI Terms. The CAPI Terms will be
deemed to be drafted by both parties and will not be construed against either
party. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “include” (and its
variants) are to be construed as inclusive, not exclusive, and are deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation."
10.9. No Exclusivity. You acknowledge that the CAPI Terms are non-exclusive and
nothing in the CAPI Terms will be deemed to limit ModMed’s right to offer
similar services to third parties. Nothing in the CAPI Terms will be deemed to
restrict ModMed from selling, marketing, or licensing, whether by itself or
through any third party, or from engaging others to market or solicit the sale or
license of products or services similar to the Applications anywhere in the world
to any existing, prospective, or future customer, including any ModMed
Customer, or from entering into any agreement with any third party.
10.10. Entire Agreement. The CAPI Terms set forth the entire agreement between
the parties regarding the CAPI Services and supersede any prior or
contemporaneous communications (whether written or oral) between the
parties, but solely with respect to the CAPI Services. Except as expressly set
forth in the CAPI Terms, there are no third-party beneficiaries to the CAPI
Terms.

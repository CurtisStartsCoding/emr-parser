ModMed
Proprietary API Terms of Use
Last Updated: December 23, 2022
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. In these Proprietary API Terms of Use (“API TOU”), Modernizing Medicine, Inc.
will be referred to as “ModMed” and terms like “we”, “our”, or “us”. Capitalized
terms used in these API TOU without definition will have the meanings in
Appendix 1.
1.2. These API TOU govern your access to and use of our API Services. Please read
these API TOU carefully before you use the API Services as they are a legal
agreement between ModMed and you once they are accepted. The API
Services are also governed by our Terms of Use (“TOU”), which also include
terms related to other ModMed services, including our websites. These API
TOU are incorporated into and are part of the TOU (the API TOU and the TOU,
collectively, the “API Terms”). Please also review our Privacy Policy to learn
about our information collection, use, and privacy practices. For example, our
Privacy Policy applies to any personal information we may collect when you use
the API Services. For clarity, these API TOU do not apply to the Certified APIs,
which terms may be found here.
1.3. By using or accessing any of the API Services you accept and agree to be
bound by the API Terms. If you do not agree with any portion of the API Terms,
then do not use any API Services. You represent and warrant that you are at
least 18 years old and that you possess the legal ability to accept the API
Terms.
1.4. If you are using the API Services on behalf of an entity, then: (i) you represent
and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the API Terms, (ii)
you agree to be bound by the API Terms on behalf of that entity, (iii) you will
require all users to comply with the API Terms, and (iv) references to “you”,
“your”, and similar terms refer to that entity.
1.5. If you have a Primary Agreement to use the API Services. “Primary
Agreement” means: (i) for ModMed Customers, your Transaction Documents
(as defined in the TOU), (ii) if you are a ModMed Vendor, a written, binding
agreement between you and ModMed, and (iii) for Application providers who
are not ModMed Customers or ModMed Vendors, a written, binding agreement
between you and each ModMed Customer or Patient containing appropriate
terms to cover the Data you will be exfiltrating, or transmitting to us, via the
APIs. The Primary Agreement will set forth your rights and obligations related to
Data, including its access, use, provisioning, and retention. ModMed enters into
unique Primary Agreements with ModMed Customers and ModMed Vendors.
The API Terms supplement Primary Agreements with respect to use of the API
Services. In the event of a conflict between a Primary Agreement and the API
Terms, (a) the API Terms will control regarding use of the API Services and (b)
the Primary Agreement will control regarding other matters, such as the use,
provisioning, and retention of Data.
2. ACCOUNTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
This section 2 applies to Application providers.
2.1. User Accounts.
2.1.1. To access and use certain aspects of the API Services, you must register
by providing certain information (e.g., name, contact information,
Application details, etc.). You must provide us with true, accurate, and
complete information on your registration and keep all provided information
up to date. As part of our review of your registration, we may request
additional information. Once you have completed your registration, we will
provide you with Credentials.
2.1.2. You must protect your Credentials. Do not let anyone else use your
Credentials and do not use anyone else’s Credentials. Notify us
immediately if: (i) your Credentials are lost or stolen, (ii) you become aware
of any unauthorized use of your Credentials, or (iii) you become aware of
any unauthorized use of the API Services or any other breach of security
that might affect the API Services. You are fully responsible for any activity
under your account. Credentials may not be embedded in open source
projects.
2.2. Development. You may use your Credentials to access the Test Environment.
In the Test Environment, you may only use test data; you may not upload,
transmit, or otherwise enter any “live” or “real” data. Performance in the Test
Environment may differ from that in the Production Environment.
2.3. Customer Activation. In certain cases, for Data to be exchanged via the APIs
the applicable ModMed Customer must activate use of such APIs in our
Systems. We are not responsible for any ModMed Customer’s failure or delay in
activating any APIs or deactivation of any APIs.
3. USE OF THE API SERVICES
3.1. Permission to Use the API Services. If you are an Application provider, we
grant you the right to: (i) access and use the API Services in a Production
Environment, (ii) use the API Services to help you develop your Applications,

these rights if you violate the API Terms or any applicable Laws. The API
Services are the proprietary property of ModMed or its third-party licensors and
are protected by intellectual property and other Laws. No rights are granted to

Information on behalf of ModMed or a ModMed Customer, then you must
first have one or more Business Associate agreements (each a “Business
Associate Agreement”) with either us or each ModMed Customer to the
extent required by HIPAA. The API Terms are not a Business Associate
Agreement and may not be construed as creating any Business Associate
relationship. By using the APIs to access or send Protected Health
Information, you represent and warrant that you have signed all Business
Associate Agreements or other arrangements as may be required for such
access or transmission to comply with HIPAA or any other applicable Laws.

or any server, network, or system associated with the API Services or
Systems;
3.4.9. Not attempt to breach, defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or
otherwise circumvent any firewall, encryption, security, authentication
routines, or software protection mechanisms in the API Services or
Systems, including any such mechanism used to restrict or control the
functionality of the API Services or Systems;
3.4.10. Not use any automated program, tool, or process (including web
crawlers, scrapers, robots, bots, spiders, and automated scripts) to access
the API Services, the Systems, or any server, network, or system

an Application provider, your Application) will not contain or introduce any
viruses or other harmful or malicious code, software, computer instructions,
devices, or techniques that can or were designed to threaten, infect, damage,
disable, or shut down the API Services or the Systems or any other technology,
software, solution, equipment, or computer system (e.g., no viruses, worms,
Trojan horses, malware, etc.).
3.6. Open Source. If you are an Application provider, you represent and warrant
that your Applications will not contain any software code that is subject to a
license that, when used in conjunction with the API Services, requires our
software code, or other software code combined or distributed with our
software code, to be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii)
licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (iii) redistributable at no
charge.
3.7. Costs and Technology Requirements. You will be responsible for all of your
own costs to perform under the API Terms. You are solely responsible for
providing and maintaining, at your own risk, option, and expense, appropriate
software, hardware, and other technology needed for you to receive and use
the API Services, which must comply with the API Terms and the
Documentation.
3.8. Customer Support. If you are an Application provider, you will be solely
responsible for all aspects of the sales, enrollment, implementation of, training,
maintenance, and support related to a ModMed Customer’s use of your
Applications.

developers, suppliers, affiliates, and other individuals and entities; and (vi)
ModMed is not responsible for any Application, the use or disclosure of Data by
an Application or its provider, or any other acts or omissions by an Application
provider. An Application provider’s use and disclosure of your Data is governed
solely by the agreement between you and the Application provider. The data
elements sent or received via an API may change over time. You can review the
then-current data elements sent to or received from an Application in Firm
Admin.
4. CHANGES TO THE API TERMS AND THE API SERVICES
4.1. Changes to the API Terms. We may change the API Terms at any time. The
date last updated is at the top of the API Terms. Please check the API Terms
regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes to the API Terms. We will
use reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes to these API TOU
before such changes take effect to afford you with a reasonable opportunity to
update your Applications to preserve compatibility with the API Services, such
as by posting a notice directly on the API Services, by sending an email
notification (if you have provided your email address to us), or by other
reasonable methods. Your use of the API Services after changes to the API
Terms means you have accepted the changes. If you do not agree with the
changes, stop using the API Services before the changes take effect or
immediately upon learning of changes that have already taken effect. If you
accessed or used the API Services before the initial effective date of the API
Terms, your use of the API Services after such effective date means you have
accepted the API Terms and that you agree that the API Terms govern your use
of the API Services.
4.2. Changes to, and Monitoring of, the API Services. (i) We may modify the
operation of, or any feature of, the API Services at any time. We will use

you have provided your email address to us), or by other reasonable methods.
(ii) We also may, with or without notice, and without liability to you or any other
party: (a) investigate any suspected or alleged misuse of the API Services and
cooperate with any law enforcement or other governmental entity or any other
third parties in such investigation, and (b) disclose information about your use
of the API Services in connection with a law enforcement or other governmental
entity investigation or in response to a lawful court order or subpoena. ModMed

API Services and Systems, and assess the quality and security of the
Applications.
4.3. Updates.

agree that ModMed has no obligation to provide any Updates or to
continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality.
4.3.2. Portions of the API Services may not properly operate if you do not install
all Updates, so we encourage you to promptly install all Updates. We may

Terms.

7. NO WARRANTIES
THE API SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MODMED AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO AND
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE API SERVICES, WHETHER
ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, TERMS, OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
AND TITLE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE,

STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY) FOR (i) ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
INFORMATION OF ANY KIND) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE
OF THE API SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
LOSS OR DAMAGES OR (ii) DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

THE API SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLAIM IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR
TO THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OR (B) $500.
8.2. EACH PROVISION OF THE API TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE
BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS
SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE API
TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THE API TERMS WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY
LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
8.3. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES OR
TOTAL LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
9. INDEMNITY
In addition to any indemnification obligations you may have, you will indemnify
ModMed and its affiliates and ModMed’s and its affiliates’ officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, advisors, contractors, and consultants
(collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, actions, suits,
demands, liabilities, damages, losses, penalties, interest, fines, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) arising out of or related to: (i)
third-party claims arising out of or related to your use of, inability to use, or reliance
upon the API Services, (ii) the Applications, including your provision of or use of any
Application, (iii) an Application provider’s act or omission (including a Data incident or
breach), or (iv) your violation of the API Terms or applicable Law.
10. MISCELLANEOUS
10.1. Notice. ModMed may provide you with notices, including those regarding
changes to these API TOU, by postings on our websites, on the API Services,
or by other means (e.g., via email).
10.2. Governing Law. The API Terms and any claim or dispute between you and
ModMed arising out of or relating to the API Services or the API Terms will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Florida,
without regard to any provision of Florida Law that would require or permit the
application of the substantive Law of another jurisdiction. Any claim or dispute
between the parties will be resolved on an individual basis in the state or federal
courts of the State of Florida and the United States, respectively, in or with
jurisdiction over Palm Beach County, Florida. If you are a United States city,
county, or state government entity, then the following applies instead of the
language above: the parties agree to remain silent regarding governing Law and
venue.
10.3. Regulatory Acknowledgments. The parties’ intent is that the API Terms
comply with the 21st Century Cures Act and any provision of the API Terms that
does not comply with the 21st Century Cures Act will be replaced as described
in section 10.5. Nothing in the API Terms will be construed to prohibit or restrict
any communication in a manner that violates the Condition of Certification at 45
C.F.R. § 170.403(a). Each party acknowledges and intends that the terms
contained in the API Terms that relate to the content and manner of a request
for access, exchange, or use of electronic health information (as defined at 45
C.F.R. § 171.102) reflect the parties’ mutual agreement (in an arm’s-length
transaction without coercion) and meet the “content” and “manner requested”
conditions of the Content and Manner Exception at 45 C.F.R. §§ 171.301(a) and
(b)(1), respectively.
10.4. Waiver. A waiver of a provision of the API Terms must be in writing and
signed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. ModMed’s failure
to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the API Terms will not constitute
a waiver of such right or provision.
10.5. Severability. If any provision of the API Terms is declared void or
unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the parties will replace
such provision with a substitute that as closely as possible reflects the parties’
original intent (including economics and allocations of risk) and is enforceable,
and the validity of the other provisions and of the API Terms as a whole will not
be affected.
10.6. Independent Contractor. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or
agency relationship exists between you and ModMed as a result of the API
Terms or use of the API Services. ModMed is not a third-party service provider
under PCI-DSS.
10.7. Force Majeure. ModMed will not be liable for failure or delay in performing
its obligations if such failure or delay is due to a force majeure event or other
circumstances beyond ModMed’s reasonable control, including acts of any
governmental body, war, cyber war or attack, terrorism, insurrection, sabotage,
embargo, fire, flood, severe weather, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, labor
disturbance, pandemic or other public health emergency, interruption of or
delay in the internet or transportation, unavailability of third-party services,
failure of third-party software or services, or inability to obtain raw materials,
supplies, or power used in or equipment needed for provision of the API
Services.
10.8. Interpretation. Headings used in the API Terms are for convenience only and
will not be used in interpreting the API Terms. The API Terms will be deemed to
be drafted by both parties and will not be construed against either party. Unless
the context otherwise requires, the term “include” (and its variants) are to be
construed as inclusive, not exclusive, and are deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation."
10.9. No Exclusivity. You acknowledge that the API Terms are non-exclusive and
nothing in the API Terms will be deemed to limit ModMed’s right to offer similar
services to third parties. Nothing in the API Terms will be deemed to restrict
ModMed from selling, marketing, or licensing, whether by itself or through any
third party, or from engaging others to market or solicit the sale or license of
products or services similar to the Applications anywhere in the world to any
existing, prospective, or future customer, including any ModMed Customer, or
from entering into any agreement with any third party.
10.10. Entire Agreement. The API Terms set forth the entire agreement between
the parties regarding the API Services and supersede any prior or
contemporaneous communications (whether written or oral) between the
parties, but solely with respect to the API Services. Except as expressly set
forth in the API Terms, there are no third-party beneficiaries to the API Terms.

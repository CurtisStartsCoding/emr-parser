# Sample Code

This directory contains reference implementations and code samples for the RadOrderPad EMR Extension.

## Files

- **sample-implementation.ts** - A complete example implementation showing:
  - EMR detection logic
  - Patient data parsing strategies
  - Form filling logic
  - Chrome extension message handling
  - Security features (encryption, audit logging)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is NOT production code!** 

These samples are provided as reference material to help understand the implementation approach. When building the actual extension:

1. Follow the setup guide in [docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md](../SETUP-GUIDE.md)
2. Split the code into proper modules as shown in [docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md](../DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)
3. Implement proper error handling and testing
4. Ensure all security and compliance requirements are met

## Usage

Use these samples to:
- Understand the overall architecture
- See examples of parsing strategies
- Reference the Chrome extension APIs usage
- Understand the security implementation approach

Do NOT:
- Copy this code directly into production
- Use this as-is for the actual extension
- Skip the proper development process outlined in the guides
